## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **npm** v9 or higher
- All devices on the **same local network**
- Microphone access on player devices

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Game

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Server** on port 3001
- **Client** on port 3000
- **Ngrok tunnels** for mobile access from anywhere

The terminal will display the **ngrok URLs** that mobile devices can use to connect from any network (WiFi or cellular data).

The Host UI will show a **green banner** with copyable URLs for:
- 🖥️ Host UI
- 🎤 Player 1
- 🎤 Player 2

**Mobile players can connect from anywhere using these ngrok URLs!**

> **Note**: The ngrok authtoken is already configured in the project.

#### Alternative: Local Network Only (No Ngrok)

If you only want localhost/LAN access without ngrok:

```bash
npm run dev:local
```

**Access URLs (same WiFi only):**
| Role | URL | Device |
|------|-----|--------|
| Host | `http://localhost:3000/host` | Main display (TV/monitor) |
| Player 1 | `http://<host-ip>:3000/client?p=1` | Phone/tablet (same WiFi) |
| Player 2 | `http://<host-ip>:3000/client?p=2` | Phone/tablet (same WiFi) |

> **Note**: Replace `<host-ip>` with your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### 3. Setup the Song

On the **Host UI**:
1. Paste a **YouTube URL** and click "Load"
2. Upload a **MIDI file** (.mid) of the song
3. (Optional) Paste **LRC lyrics** and click "Parse Lyrics"

### 4. Ready Up

On each **Client UI**:
1. Click "Enable Microphone"
2. Click "Ready Up"

### 5. Start the Battle!

Once both players are ready, the Host can click **START BATTLE**.

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Segments
The song is divided into **4 equal segments**:
- Segment 1: Player 1 attacks
- Segment 2: Player 2 attacks
- Segment 3: Player 1 attacks
- Segment 4: Player 2 attacks

### Scoring
- **Perfect pitch** (within 10 cents): 100% accuracy → 20 damage
- **Good pitch** (within 25 cents): 70-100% accuracy → 15-20 damage
- **OK pitch** (within 50 cents): 30-70% accuracy → 9-15 damage
- **Miss** (>50 cents off): 0 damage

### Win Conditions
1. Reduce opponent's HP to 0 → **KO Victory**
2. Song ends → **Higher score wins**
3. Tie score → **Higher accuracy % wins**

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `constants.ts` to adjust:
- `MAX_HP` - Starting health (default: 100)
- `BASE_DAMAGE` - Minimum damage per hit (default: 5)
- `MAX_BONUS_DAMAGE` - Maximum bonus damage (default: 15)
- `PERFECT_THRESHOLD_CENTS` - Perfect pitch tolerance (default: 10)

## 🎵 Adding MIDI Files

### Using the Midi Files Folder (Recommended)

1. Place your `.mid` or `.midi` files in the `Midi Files` folder in the project root
2. The Host UI will automatically detect and list them in a dropdown
3. Select your MIDI file from the dropdown - no upload needed!

### Uploading MIDI Files

Alternatively, you can upload MIDI files directly through the Host UI using the file upload button.

### Where to Find MIDI Files

You can find MIDI files for popular songs at:
- [BitMidi](https://bitmidi.com/)
- [FreeMidi](https://freemidi.org/)
- [MidiWorld](https://www.midiworld.com/)

## 📝 Getting LRC Lyrics

Lyrics are fetched from or can be pasted from:
- [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net/) - Search by song title
- [Megalobiz](https://www.megalobiz.com/)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"
- Ensure the server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check firewall settings for ports 3000 and 3001

### "Microphone not working"
- Grant microphone permissions in browser
- Use HTTPS or localhost (required for mic access)
- Check if another app is using the microphone

### "Players can't connect from phones"
- Use your computer's local IP, not `localhost`
- Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check firewall allows incoming connections

### "Ngrok tunnels not working"
- Ensure you're running `npm run dev:mobile` (not just `npm run dev`)
- Check that the ngrok URLs appear in the terminal output
- The Host UI will show a green banner with mobile URLs when ngrok is active
- If ngrok fails, check your internet connection
- Free ngrok accounts have session limits - tunnels may expire after a few hours

### "Mobile devices can't access ngrok URLs"
- Ensure mobile devices have internet access (can be on cellular data)
- Try opening the ngrok URL in a regular browser first to test
- Check that HTTPS warnings are accepted (ngrok uses HTTPS)
- Clear browser cache on mobile device
